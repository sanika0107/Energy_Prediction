Week 3 – Model Training & Accuracy (Plant 1)
In Week 3, a Linear Regression model was trained using the preprocessed Plant 1 dataset to predict solar energy output (DC Power).  
The dataset was split into training and testing sets, AC and DC power graphs were plotted, and model accuracy was evaluated.  
The model achieved an accuracy of 97%.
